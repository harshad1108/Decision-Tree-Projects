# 🚀 CatBoost Classification

This project demonstrates the application of **CatBoost**, a tree-based ensemble learning algorithm, for solving a real-world classification problem.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict user behavior using social network advertisement data. CatBoost efficiently handles categorical features and provides strong performance with minimal preprocessing.

## Dataset
- Social_Network_Ads.csv

## Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- CatBoost Classifier
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, CatBoost, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of **CatBoost** for classification tasks and demonstrates the use of ensemble learning methods in practical machine learning applications.
