# 🧑‍💼 Employee Promotion Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an employee is likely to be **promoted** based on performance metrics, demographics, and work-related attributes.  
Machine learning is used to assist organizations in making **data-driven promotion decisions**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given employee details such as department, education, performance rating, and work experience, predict whether the employee will be promoted or not.

This helps HR teams in:
- Fair promotion assessment
- Talent management
- Workforce planning

- `aug_test.csv`

### Key Features:
- Department  
- Education  
- Gender  
- Recruitment Channel  
- No. of Trainings  
- Age  
- Previous Year Rating  
- Length of Service  
- KPIs Met  
- Awards Won  

**Target Variable:**
- `is_promoted` (0 → Not Promoted, 1 → Promoted)
