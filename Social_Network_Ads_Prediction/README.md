# 📊 Social Network Ads Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a user will purchase a product based on **social network advertisement data** such as age, gender, and estimated salary.

The goal is to solve a real-world **binary classification problem** using machine learning.

---

## Problem Statement
Given user demographic information, predict whether the user will purchase the advertised product.

---

## Dataset
- Social_Network_Ads.csv

The dataset contains user details and a target variable indicating purchase behavior.

---

## Model Used
