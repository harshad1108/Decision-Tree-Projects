# 💳 Customer Spending Score Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer spending behavior** using demographic and lifestyle data.  
A **Decision Tree Classifier** is used to classify customers into different spending categories, helping businesses understand and segment their customers effectively.
